# Mental-Health-Sentiment
Mental health challenges often begin with subtle emotional signals hidden in text. This project uses the GoEmotions dataset (released by Google) to classify emotions in written sentences into 27 different emotion labels.

This end-to-end project:

Fine-tunes a pre-trained DistilBERT transformer model for multi-label emotion classification

Uses PyTorch and Transformers to tokenize, train, and evaluate

Plans to integrate a Streamlit-based web app for real-time usage
