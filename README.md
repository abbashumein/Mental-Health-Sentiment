# Mental Health Sentiment & Severity Detector

A deep learning NLP project that identifies emotional sentiment and severity in user-written text using DistilBERT, built with PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and Google Colab. This project is aimed at supporting mental health awareness through real-time emotion detection from natural language.

Mental health challenges often begin with subtle emotional signals hidden in text. This project uses the GoEmotions dataset (released by Google) to classify emotions in written sentences into 27 different emotion labels.

This end-to-end project:

Fine-tunes a pre-trained DistilBERT transformer model for multi-label emotion classification

Uses PyTorch and Transformers to tokenize, train, and evaluate

Plans to integrate a Streamlit-based web app for real-time usage
